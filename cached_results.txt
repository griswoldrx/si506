It is intended to be a stand-alone book in a series that covers the Internet of Things activities of the IERC - Internet of Things European Research Cluster - from technology to international cooperation and the global \u005c"state of play.\u005c" The book builds on the ideas put forward by the European Research Cluster on the Internet of Things Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda and presents views and state of the art results on the challenges facing the research, development and deployment of IoT at the global level. Today we see the integration of Industrial, Business and Consumer Internet which is bringing together the Internet of People, Internet of Things, Internet of Energy, Internet of Vehicles, Internet of Media, Services and Enterprises in forming the backbone of the digital economy, the digital society and the foundation for the future knowledge and innovation based economy. These developments are supporting solutions for the emerging challenges of public health, aging population, environmental protection and climate change, the conservation of energy and scarce materials, enhancements to safety and security and the continuation and growth of economic prosperity. Penetration of smartphones and advances in nanoelectronics, cyber-physical systems, wireless communication, software, and Cloud computing technology will be the main drivers for IoT development. The IoT contribution is seen in the increased value of information created by the number of interconnections among things and the transformation of the processed information into knowledge shared into the Internet of Everything. The connected devices are part of ecosystems connecting people, processes, data, and things which are communicating in the Cloud using the increased storage and computing power while attempting to standardize communication and metadata. In this context, the next generation of Cloud computing technologies will need to be flexible enough to scale autonomously, adaptive enough to handle constantly changing connections and resilient enough to stand up to the huge flows of data that will occur. In 2025, analysts forecast that there will be six devices per human on the planet, which means around 50 billion more connected devices over the next 12 years. The Internet of Things market is connected to this anticipated device growth from industrial Machine to Machine (M2M) systems, smart meters and wireless sensors. Internet of Things technology will generate new services and new interfaces by creating smart environments and smart spaces with applications ranging from Smart Cities, Smart Transport, Buildings, Energy, Grid, to Smart Health and Life.",\u000a    "industryIdentifiers": [\u000a     {\u000a      "type": "ISBN_13",\u000a      "identifier": "9788792982735"\u000a     },\u000a     {\u000a      "type": "ISBN_10",\u000a      "identifier": "8792982735"\u000a     }\u000a    ],\u000a    "readingModes": {\u000a     "text": false,\u000a     "image": true\u000a    },\u000a    "pageCount": 364,\u000a    "printType": "BOOK",\u000a    "categories": [\u000a     "Technology & Engineering"\u000a    ],\u000a    "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE",\u000a    "allowAnonLogging": false,\u000a    "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1",\u000a    "imageLinks": {\u000a     "smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rHYGZ0wxLP0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",\u000a     "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rHYGZ0wxLP0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"\u000a    },\u000a    "language": "en",\u000a    "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=rHYGZ0wxLP0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=IOT&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=2&source=gbs_api",\u000a    "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rHYGZ0wxLP0C&source=gbs_api",\u000a    "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://market.android.com/details?id=book-rHYGZ0wxLP0C"\u000a   },\u000a   "saleInfo": {\u000a    "country": "US",\u000a    "saleability": "FOR_SALE",\u000a    "isEbook": true,\u000a    "listPrice": {\u000a     "amount": 101.16,\u000a     "currencyCode": "USD"\u000a    },\u000a    "retailPrice": {\u000a     "amount": 80.93,\u000a     "currencyCode": "USD"\u000a    },\u000a    "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rHYGZ0wxLP0C&rdid=book-rHYGZ0wxLP0C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api",\u000a    "offers": [\u000a     {\u000a      "finskyOfferType": 1,\u000a      "listPrice": {\u000a       "amountInMicros": 1.0116E8,\u000a       "currencyCode": "USD"\u000a      },\u000a      "retailPrice": {\u000a       "amountInMicros": 8.093E7,\u000a       "currencyCode": "USD"\u000a      },\u000a      "giftable": true\u000a     }\u000a    ]\u000a   },\u000a   "accessInfo": {\u000a    "country": "US",\u000a    "viewability": "PARTIAL",\u000a    "embeddable": true,\u000a    "publicDomain": false,\u000a    "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED",\u000a    "epub": {\u000a     "isAvailable": false\u000a    },\u000a    "pdf": {\u000a     "isAvailable": true,\u000a     "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/Internet_of_Things-sample-pdf.acsm?id=rHYGZ0wxLP0C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"\u000a    },\u000a    "webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=rHYGZ0wxLP0C&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api",\u000a    "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE",\u000a    "quoteSharingAllowed": false\u000a   },\u000a   "searchInfo": {\u000a    "textSnippet": "The book aims to provide a broad overview of various topics of the Internet of Things (IoT) from the research and development priorities to enabling technologies, architecture, security, privacy, interoperability and industrial applications ..."\u000a   }\u000a  },\u000a  {\u000a   "kind": "books#volume",\u000a   "id": "JPKGBAAAQBAJ",\u000a   "etag": "2/Bjvoqxbg0",\u000a   "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/JPKGBAAAQBAJ",\u000a   "volumeInfo": {\u000a    "title": "Internet of Things: A Hands-On Approach",\u000a    "subtitle": "",\u000a    "authors": [\u000a     "Arshdeep Bahga",\u000a     "Vijay Madisetti"\u000a    ],\u000a    "publisher": "VPT",\u000a    "publishedDate": "2014-08-09",\u000a    "description": "Internet of Things (IoT) refers to physical and virtual objects that have unique identities and are connected to the internet to facilitate intelligent applications that make energy, logistics, industrial control, retail, agriculture and many other domains \u005c"smarter\u005c". Internet of Things is a new revolution of the Internet that is rapidly gathering momentum driven by the advancements in sensor networks, mobile devices, wireless communications, networking and cloud technologies. Experts forecast that by the year 2020 there will be a total of 50 billion devices/things connected to the internet. This book is written as a textbook on Internet of Things for educational programs at colleges and universities, and also for IoT vendors and service providers who may be interested in offering a broader perspective of Internet of Things to accompany their own customer and developer training programs. The typical reader is expected to have completed a couple of courses in programming using traditional high-level languages at the college-level, and is either a senior or a beginning graduate student in one of the science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) fields. Like our companion book on Cloud Computing, we have tried to write a comprehensive book that transfers knowledge through an immersive \u005c"hands on\u005c" approach, where the reader is provided the necessary guidance and knowledge to develop working code for real-world IoT applications. Additional support is available at the book's website: www.internet-of-things-book.com Organization The book is organized into 3 main parts, comprising of a total of 11 chapters. Part I covers the building blocks of Internet of Things (IoTs) and their characteristics. A taxonomy of IoT systems is proposed comprising of various IoT levels with increasing levels of complexity. Domain specific Internet of Things and their real-world applications are described. A generic design methodology for IoT is proposed. An IoT system management approach using NETCONF-YANG is described. Part II introduces the reader to the programming aspects of Internet of Things with a view towards rapid prototyping of complex IoT applications. We chose Python as the primary programming language for this book, and an introduction to Python is also included within the text to bring readers to a common level of expertise. We describe packages, frameworks and cloud services including the WAMP-AutoBahn, Xively cloud and Amazon Web Services which can be used for developing IoT systems. We chose the Raspberry Pi device for the examples in this book. Reference architectures for different levels of IoT applications are examined in detail.

Maintaining access control, authentication and managing the identity of devices while they interact with other devices, services and people is an important challenge for identity management. The identity management presents significant challenges in the current Internet communication. These challenges are exacerbated in the internet of things by the unbound number of devices and expected limitations in constrained resources. Current identity management solutions are mainly concerned with identities that are used by end users, and services to identify themselves in the networked world. However, these identity management solutions are designed by considering that significant resources are available and applicability of these identity management solutions to the resource constrained internet of things needs a thorough analysis. Technical topics discussed in the book include: Internet of Things; Identity Management; Identity models in Internet of Things; Identity management and trust in the Internet of Things context; Authentication and access control; Identity management for Internet of Things contributes to the area of identity management for ubiquitous devices in the Internet of Things. It initially presents the motivational factors together with the identity management problems in the context of Internet of Things and proposes an identity management framework. Following this, it refers to the major challenges for Identity management and presents different identity management models. This book also presents relationship between identity and trust, different approaches for trust management, authentication and access control. Key milestones identified for Identity management are clustering with hierarchical addressing, trust management, mutual authentication and access control. Identity management for Internet of Things is ideal for personnel in computer/communication industries as well as academic staff and master/research students in wireless communication, computer science, operational research, electrical engineering and telecommunication systems Internet, and cloud computing.

However, with so much hype, still there is a lot of confusion on what does Internet of Things actually mean and what it takes to build IoT applications and how to apply it in various industries. There exist many definitions on \u005c"Internet of Things\u005c" and even getting on to a same terminology and definition seems difficult nowadays. We have seen multiple definitions over a period of time, such as 'Internet of Everything', 'Internet of your Things', 'Internet of People' and the list goes on. They all mean the same, so let's start with a simple definition of Internet of Things. \u005c"Internet of Things is a vision where every object in the world has the potential to connect to the Internet and provide their data so as to derive actionable insights on its own or through other connected objects\u005c" The object can be anything - a vehicle, machinery, airport, city, people, phone or even a shoe. From a connected vehicle solution, you can understand the driver behaviour and vehicle usage patterns, from a connected machines solution you can determine when do machines need servicing, from a connected airport solution you can understand many things like - how much time the passenger needs to wait for check-in and security, from an operating perspective it could help to optimize the passenger movement and ensure the right equipments are available at the right time to ensure quick serviceability and finally say, from a connected footwear solution you can understand how much you have run so far and your app can automatically purchase a new pair of shoes based on the remaining shoe life. As we can see, it's not just about connectivity, but how to use the connected data in context of your application or for that matter other connected solutions to derive insights which can't be uncovered before. Today we are seeing data (both structured and unstructured) growing by leaps and bounds available through mediums like blogs, social media, transactional systems etc. With advent of IoT, you will see a large volume of raw data emitting from devices like sensors. Such huge and complex set of data, if not attended to, can go wasted and opportunity lost in terms of building smart environment around us. While focusing on issue of addressing this web of complexity, often understanding the real benefit of IoT is lost and most importantly how to get started on IoT. In this book, our focus will be to provide a clear vision on IoT and everything you should know to get started on applying and building Enterprise IoT applications in any industry. The concepts listed down in the book are applicable across industries. Till date, it's difficult to find a single perspective of what does an Enterprise IoT stack actually mean and our intent is to provide an applicability guide that can be taken as reference for building any IoT application. In the course of the book, we would describe some of the key components of Internet of Things through our Enterprise IoT stack. We would look at how to incrementally apply IoT transformations to build connected products in various industries. At the end, we would understand the technical strategy and how to build IoT applications using IoT cloud offerings from Microsoft, IBM, and Amazon and even build one using open source technologies. To summarize, as part of the book we would cover the following - * A detailed overview of key components of Internet of Things and most comprehensive view of an Enterprise IoT stack. * How to apply IoT in context of real world applications by covering detailed use cases on manufacturing, automotive and home automation. * Understand the technical strategy and how to implement IoT applications using Microsoft Azure and IoT Suite, IBM Internet of Things Foundation and BlueMix, Amazon IoT and AWS services and various open source technologies like Apache Kakfa, Apache Spark and map it to our Enterprise IoT Stack.",\u000a    "industryIdentifiers": [\u000a     {\u000a      "type": "ISBN_10",\u000a      "identifier": "1523411643"\u000a     },\u000a     {\u000a      "type": "ISBN_13",\u000a      "identifier": "9781523411641"\u000a     }\u000a    ],\u000a    "readingModes": {\u000a     "text": false,\u000a     "image": false\u000a    },\u000a    "pageCount": 146,\u000a    "printType": "BOOK",\u000a    "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE",\u000a    "allowAnonLogging": false,\u000a    "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0",\u000a    "imageLinks": {\u000a     "smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m8OpjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",\u000a     "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m8OpjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"\u000a    },\u000a    "language": "en",\u000a    "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=m8OpjwEACAAJ&dq=IOT&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=16&source=gbs_api",\u000a    "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=m8OpjwEACAAJ&dq=IOT&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api",\u000a    "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Enterprise_Iot.html?hl=&id=m8OpjwEACAAJ"\u000a   },\u000a   "saleInfo": {\u000a    "country": "US",\u000a    "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE",\u000a    "isEbook": false\u000a   },\u000a   "accessInfo": {\u000a    "country": "US",\u000a    "viewability": "NO_PAGES",\u000a    "embeddable": false,\u000a    "publicDomain": false,\u000a    "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED",\u000a    "epub": {\u000a     "isAvailable": false\u000a    },\u000a    "pdf": {\u000a     "isAvailable": false\u000a    },\u000a    "webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=m8OpjwEACAAJ&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api",\u000a    "accessViewStatus": "NONE",\u000a    "quoteSharingAllowed": false\u000a   },\u000a   "searchInfo": {\u000a    "textSnippet": "In this book, our focus will be to provide a clear vision on IoT and everything you should know to get started on applying and building Enterprise IoT applications in any industry."\u000a   }\u000a  },\u000a  {\u000a   "kind": "books#volume",\u000a   "id": "EGNm4iT8TC8C",\u000a   "etag": "Swz/bKRA5qY",\u000a   "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/EGNm4iT8TC8C",\u000a   "volumeInfo": {\u000a    "title": "The Internet of Things",\u000a    "subtitle": "Connecting Objects",\u000a    "authors": [\u000a     "Hakima Chaouchi"\u000a    ],\u000a    "publisher": "John Wiley & Sons",\u000a    "publishedDate": "2013-02-04",\u000a    "description": "Internet of Things: Connecting Objects\u2026 puts forward the technologies and the networking architectures which make it possible to support the Internet of Things.

And the amazing part is that there is no code in the book. Over the next decade, most devices connected to the Internet will not be used by people in the familiar way that personal computers, tablets and smart phones are. Billions of interconnected devices will be monitoring the environment, transportation systems, factories, farms, forests, utilities, soil and weather conditions, oceans and resources. Many of these sensors and actuators will be networked into autonomous sets, with much of the information being exchanged machine-to-machine directly and without human involvement. Machine-to-machine communications are typically terse. Most sensors and actuators will report or act upon small pieces of information - \u005c"chirps\u005c". Burdening these devices with current network protocol stacks is inefficient, unnecessary and unduly increases their cost of ownership. This must change. The architecture of the Internet of Things must evolve now by incorporating simpler protocols toward at the edges of the network, or remain forever inefficient. Rethinking the Internet of Things describes reasons why we must rethink current approaches to the Internet of Things. Appropriate architectures that will coexist with existing networking protocols are described in detail. An architecture comprised of integrator functions, propagator nodes, and end devices, along with their interactions, is explored. What you\u2019ll learn Discusses the difference between the \u005c"normal\u005c" Internet and the Internet of Things. Describes a new architecture and its components in the \u005c"chirp\u005c" context. Explains the shortcomings of IP for IoT. Describes the anatomy of the IoT. Describes how to build a suitable network to maximize the amazing potential of the IoT. Who this book is for Thought leaders, executives, architectural, standards and development leaders in the evolving IoT industry. Corporations and organizations whose commercial products could be adapted simply to be functioning devices on the IOT while saving billions of dollars in unnecessary costs or proprietary designs. Those who wish to capitalize on technology change and those interested in the Internet, its capabilities and the need to improve it. Table of ContentsForeword Preface Chapter Goal: The reader will understand the new demands and opportunities of the Internet of Things (IoT). The preface introduces the idea of a new, simplified architectural approach that draws on nature. Chapter 1: It's Different Out Here Chapter Goal: Reader should understand the difference between traditional Internet networking and the Internet of Things. What are the unique characteristics of the IoT that demand a new architecture? Why traditional architectures such as IP are a poor fit. Characteristics of an IoT-optimized architecture. Chapter 2: Anatomy of the Internet of Things Chapter Goal: Reader will understand the underlying principles of the emerging IoT architecture. Fundamental concepts are: the division of networking complexity among different devices; the make-up of the \u005c"Chirp\u005c" and how they are propagated; distinctions between transport and functional topologies; the concept of neighborhoods or zones of interest. Chapter 3: On the Edge Chapter Goal: Reader will learn the principles and characteristics of the End Devices in the IoT and how these will often differ from our present understanding of the Smartphone, tablet, and laptop. How the minimal networking needs of many IoT devices dictate elements of the architecture. Chapter 4: Building a Web of Things Chapter Goal: Reader will learn the characteristics and functionality of the Propagator node in the IoT Architecture. Some communications principles are introduced which will be more fully explored in Chapter 6. Chapter 5: Small Data, Big Data, and Human Interaction Chapter Goal: Reader will understand the role of Integrator functions in the IoT, the point in the IoT where humans interact to gain information from IoT data and to set parameters and control end devices. An explanation of zones of interest and neighborhoods, with a discussion of incorporating \u005c"small data\u005c" from chirps into big data analysis. Chapter 6: An Architecture for the Frontier Chapter Goal: Reader will gain an understanding of the challenges inherent in a communications architecture for the massive scale of the IoT. Exploiting the opportunities inherent in a machine-to-machine environment, a much simpler architecture is described in detail that readily scales to the required scope. This chapter adds technical depth to ideas introduced in Chapters 3-5. Chapter 7: IoT Examples and Applications Chapter Goal: Reader will learn about current and emerging applications in the Internet of Things. Reference wile b made to new applications enabled by the simpler architecture described in this book that are difficult or not possible with traditional networking protocols. Chapter 8: Blueprint to the Internet of Things Chapter Goal: Exploring the steps to IoT deployment. Standards based versus ad hoc approaches, call for industry cooperation and consortia. Intermediate incremental steps to broader adoption.",\u000a    "industryIdentifiers": [\u000a     {\u000a      "type": "ISBN_13",\u000a      "identifier": "9781430257417"\u000a     },\u000a     {\u000a      "type": "ISBN_10",\u000a      "identifier": "1430257415"\u000a     }\u000a    ],\u000a    "readingModes": {\u000a     "text": true,\u000a     "image": true\u000a    },\u000a    "pageCount": 192,\u000a    "printType": "BOOK",\u000a    "categories": [\u000a     "Technology & Engineering"\u000a    ],\u000a    "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE",\u000a    "allowAnonLogging": true,\u000a    "contentVersion": "0.3.2.0.preview.3",\u000a    "imageLinks": {\u000a     "smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mPgFAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",\u000a     "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mPgFAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"\u000a    },\u000a    "language": "en",\u000a    "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=mPgFAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=IOT&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=22&source=gbs_api",\u000a    "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=mPgFAwAAQBAJ&dq=IOT&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api",\u000a    "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Rethinking_the_Internet_of_Things.html?hl=&id=mPgFAwAAQBAJ"\u000a   },\u000a   "saleInfo": {\u000a    "country": "US",\u000a    "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE",\u000a    "isEbook": false\u000a   },\u000a   "accessInfo": {\u000a    "country": "US",\u000a    "viewability": "PARTIAL",\u000a    "embeddable": true,\u000a    "publicDomain": false,\u000a    "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED",\u000a    "epub": {\u000a     "isAvailable": true,\u000a     "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/Rethinking_the_Internet_of_Things-sample-epub.acsm?id=mPgFAwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"\u000a    },\u000a    "pdf": {\u000a     "isAvailable": true,\u000a     "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/Rethinking_the_Internet_of_Things-sample-pdf.acsm?id=mPgFAwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"\u000a    },\u000a    "webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=mPgFAwAAQBAJ&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api",\u000a    "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE",\u000a    "quoteSharingAllowed": false\u000a   },\u000a   "searchInfo": {\u000a    "textSnippet": "Describes how to build a suitable network to maximize the amazing potential of the IoT.

Unfortunately, it has also attracted the attention of hackers. Security and Privacy in Internet of Things (IoTs): Models, Algorithms, and Implementations brings together some of the top IoT security experts from around the world who contribute their knowledge regarding different IoT security aspects. It answers the question \u005c"How do we use efficient algorithms, models, and implementations to cover the four important aspects of IoT security, i.e., confidentiality, authentication, integrity, and availability?\u005c" The book consists of five parts covering attacks and threats, privacy preservation, trust and authentication, IoT data security, and social awareness. The first part introduces all types of IoT attacks and threats and demonstrates the principle of countermeasures against those attacks. It provides detailed introductions to specific attacks such as malware propagation and Sybil attacks. The second part addresses privacy-preservation issues related to the collection and distribution of data, including medical records. The author uses smart buildings as an example to discuss privacy-protection solutions. The third part describes different types of trust models in the IoT infrastructure, discusses access control to IoT data, and provides a survey of IoT authentication issues. The fourth part emphasizes security issues during IoT data computation. It introduces computational security issues in IoT data processing, security design in time series data aggregation, key generation for data transmission, and concrete security protocols during data access. The fifth and final part considers policy and human behavioral features and covers social-context-based privacy and trust design in IoT platforms as well as policy-based informed consent in the IoT.",\u000a    "industryIdentifiers": [\u000a     {\u000a      "type": "ISBN_13",\u000a      "identifier": "9781498723190"\u000a     },\u000a     {\u000a      "type": "ISBN_10",\u000a      "identifier": "1498723195"\u000a     }\u000a    ],\u000a    "readingModes": {\u000a     "text": false,\u000a     "image": true\u000a    },\u000a    "pageCount": 584,\u000a    "printType": "BOOK",\u000a    "categories": [\u000a     "Computers"\u000a    ],\u000a    "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE",\u000a    "allowAnonLogging": false,\u000a    "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0",\u000a    "imageLinks": {\u000a     "smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kr_1CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",\u000a     "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kr_1CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"\u000a    },\u000a    "language": "en",\u000a    "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=kr_1CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA479&dq=IOT&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=33&source=gbs_api",\u000a    "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kr_1CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api",\u000a    "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://market.android.com/details?id=book-kr_1CwAAQBAJ"\u000a   },\u000a   "saleInfo": {\u000a    "country": "US",\u000a    "saleability": "FOR_SALE",\u000a    "isEbook": true,\u000a    "listPrice": {\u000a     "amount": 79.95,\u000a     "currencyCode": "USD"\u000a    },\u000a    "retailPrice": {\u000a     "amount": 63.96,\u000a     "currencyCode": "USD"\u000a    },\u000a    "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kr_1CwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-kr_1CwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api",\u000a    "offers": [\u000a     {\u000a      "finskyOfferType": 1,\u000a      "listPrice": {\u000a       "amountInMicros": 7.995E7,\u000a       "currencyCode": "USD"\u000a      },\u000a      "retailPrice": {\u000a       "amountInMicros": 6.396E7,\u000a       "currencyCode": "USD"\u000a      },\u000a      "giftable": true\u000a     }\u000a    ]\u000a   },\u000a   "accessInfo": {\u000a    "country": "US",\u000a    "viewability": "PARTIAL",\u000a    "embeddable": true,\u000a    "publicDomain": false,\u000a    "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED",\u000a    "epub": {\u000a     "isAvailable": false\u000a    },\u000a    "pdf": {\u000a     "isAvailable": true,\u000a     "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/Security_and_Privacy_in_Internet_of_Thin-sample-pdf.acsm?id=kr_1CwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"\u000a    },\u000a    "webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=kr_1CwAAQBAJ&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api",\u000a    "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE",\u000a    "quoteSharingAllowed": false\u000a   },\u000a   "searchInfo": {\u000a    "textSnippet": "Recently, the number of Internet-connected objects and devices has exceeded \u005cu003cbr\u005cu003e\u005cnthe number of humans on Earth, marking the dawn of a new era of the \u005cu003cb\u005cu003eInternet of\u005cu003c/b\u005cu003e \u005cu003cbr\u005cu003e\u005cn\u005cu003cb\u005cu003eThings\u005cu003c/b\u005cu003e (\u005cu003cb\u005cu003eIoT\u005cu003c/b\u005cu003e).

It allows devices to communicate with each other, access information on the Internet, store and retrieve data, and interact with users, creating smart, pervasive and always-connected environments. Despite the Internet of Things being a relatively new concept, there are already a few open platforms available that enable remote and seamless management and visualization of sensor data: Cosm, Nimbits, and ThingSpeak are just a few examples. And Arduino works with all of them. The Arduino is an incredibly flexible micro-controller and development environment that cannot only be used to control devices, but can also be used to read data from all kinds of sensors. Its simplicity and extensibility, in addition to its great success and adoption by users, has led to the development of a variety of hardware extensions and software libraries that enable wired and wireless communication with the Internet. Arduino is the ideal open hardware platform for experimenting with the world of the Internet of Things. Make your Arduino talk to the world! This book will provide you with all the information you need to design and create your own Internet of Things (IoT) applications using the Arduino platform. More specifically, you will learn: About the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing concepts About open platforms that allow you to store your sensor data on the Cloud (like Cosm, Nimbits and many more) The basic usage of Arduino environment for creating your own embedded projects at low cost How to connect your Arduino with your Android phone and send data over the Internet How to connect your Arduino directly to the Internet and talk to the Cloud How to reprogram your Arduino microcontroller remotely through the Cloud Detailed Table of Contents can be found at: http://www.buildinginternetofthings.com Updated version (v1.1): Contains corrections, improvements and updates about IoT Platforms!",\u000a    "industryIdentifiers": [\u000a     {\u000a      "type": "ISBN_10",\u000a      "identifier": "1470023431"\u000a     },\u000a     {\u000a      "type": "ISBN_13",\u000a      "identifier": "9781470023430"\u000a     }\u000a    ],\u000a    "readingModes": {\u000a     "text": false,\u000a     "image": false\u000a    },\u000a    "pageCount": 340,\u000a    "printType": "BOOK",\u000a    "categories": [\u000a     "Technology & Engineering"\u000a    ],\u000a    "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE",\u000a    "allowAnonLogging": false,\u000a    "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0",\u000a    "imageLinks": {\u000a     "smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ln6RuAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",\u000a     "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ln6RuAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"\u000a    },\u000a    "language": "en",\u000a    "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=ln6RuAAACAAJ&dq=IOT&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=36&source=gbs_api",\u000a    "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=ln6RuAAACAAJ&dq=IOT&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api",\u000a    "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Building_Internet_of_Things_with_the_Ard.html?hl=&id=ln6RuAAACAAJ"\u000a   },\u000a   "saleInfo": {\u000a    "country": "US",\u000a    "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE",\u000a    "isEbook": false\u000a   },\u000a   "accessInfo": {\u000a    "country": "US",\u000a    "viewability": "NO_PAGES",\u000a    "embeddable": false,\u000a    "publicDomain": false,\u000a    "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED",\u000a    "epub": {\u000a     "isAvailable": false\u000a    },\u000a    "pdf": {\u000a     "isAvailable": false\u000a    },\u000a    "webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=ln6RuAAACAAJ&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api",\u000a    "accessViewStatus": "NONE",\u000a    "quoteSharingAllowed": false\u000a   },\u000a   "searchInfo": {\u000a    "textSnippet": "This book will provide you with all the information you need to design and create your own Internet of Things (IoT) applications using the Arduino platform."\u000a   }\u000a  },\u000a  {\u000a   "kind": "books#volume",\u000a   "id": "dt7TDQAAQBAJ",\u000a   "etag": "jf//s92vYQc",\u000a   "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/dt7TDQAAQBAJ",\u000a   "volumeInfo": {\u000a    "title": "Internet of Things and Big Data Technologies for Next Generation Healthcare",\u000a    "authors": [\u000a     "Chintan Bhatt",\u000a     "Nilanjan Dey",\u000a     "Amira S.
